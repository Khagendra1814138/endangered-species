            Their mission is to find solutions that save the endangered species by applying the best science available and working closely with local communities.
            But we should do our part as well to keep them from going extinct in order to protect the ecosystem. 
            There are many individual actions that you can take in order to make a positive impact on these endangered species.

            One of the biggest steps you can take is by becoming a messenger for those without a voice. 
            Be a supporter for endangered species. Spread your message to your family and friends, and show them how they can contribute. 
            Use social media to share existing guids and educate your friends and family. Try to reach as many people as you can.
            The power to help the endangered species is in your hands. Just by doing few small things can make a huge difference.

            Animal farming is the main cause of over water consumption, pollution, global warming and deforestation. 
            Livestock produces higher greenhouse gases on our atmosphere than consumption of fossil fuels. 
            For example, farming industry is the cause of deforestation, soil erosion, habitat loss, species extinction and more... 
            To raise animals for food, large amounts of food, water, energy, and land are required. 
            Therefore, by changing your diet to more plant-based food, you aid the endangered species and rescue of our planet.

            Even better if you travel by walking or riding bicycle as it can benifit your health as well.
            If you are driving then make sure that you are driving smart instead of wasting gas. Like go for a regular check-up of your car to make sure it does not consume extra fuel.

            It is estimated that Approximately 40% of global CO2 emissions are emitted from electricity as it involves burning of fossil fuels.
            So, by limiting your household energy consumption, you are limiting the amount of C02 being put into the environment by power plants.
            You can contribute to tackle this issue by lowering your heater temperature, turn off or use less electronic devices when not nessary like your TV etc.
            If necessary switch your energy supplier to green energy supplier. Also, you can install solar power to your household.
