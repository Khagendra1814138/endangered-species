            Did you know that over 900+ species of plants and animals have gone extinct over the five centuries.
            And more than 70 species are now considered as extinct in the wild! stated by the IUCN. 
            Extinct in the wild means that the species is the only living members kept in captivity or as a naturalized population outside its historic range due to massive habitat loss.
            The UN report states that around 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many within decades.
